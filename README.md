Oracle PDB Configuration Report 

Task 1: Create a New Pluggable Database
I created a new PDB named 'di_pdb_27623' with an admin user 'di_plsqlauca_27623' and password '1234'.

Task 2: Create and Delete Another PDB
I created a temporary PDB named 'di_to_delete_pdb_27623' and deleted it after verifying successful creation.
 
Task 3: Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM) / SQL Developer Dashboard
Since 'emctl' was not recognized in Oracle 23c AI, I used Oracle SQL Developer as an alternative dashboard. 
 
3. Issues Encountered and Solutions 
The emctl command was unavailable in Oracle 23c AI.: Used Oracle SQL Developer as an alternative .

4. Conclusion
- Successfully created a PDB with an admin user
- Created and deleted a second PDB for testing
- Verified and documented all results using SQL Developer dashboard
- screenshots are provided in the word file report
